New Readme.md... to be edited  later
To pass the checks, i had to let go of a point..
please complie each file with _putchar.c and their respectively numbered [n]-main.c files to compile successfully;
or you could add "
// #include "_putchar.c" to the second line of 
each c file respective ... Please not the [n]-main.c files, just the c files.
And compile with "cfile [n]-main.c -0 <name>"
